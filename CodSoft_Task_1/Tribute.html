         <h1>Albert Einstein</h1>
         <P>Albert Einstein was a German-born physicist who developed
           the special and general theories of relativity. He won the Nobel
            Prize in Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect.   His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. </P>
